# Install

To install the package language-m68k:

* In Atom: use app menu to navigate to Packages->Settings View->Install Packages
* Shell: `$ apm install language-mdsp56k`

# TODO

* This version doesn't recognize adresses or constants referenced within instructions.
* Short adressing mode "<" is not highlighted properly.
* Ideally, detect parallel move fields and automatically align them together.
